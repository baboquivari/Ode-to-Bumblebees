Oh Bumblebee, Oh Bumblebee,
How lovely are your branches,
Wait...

Oh Bumblebee, Oh Bumblebee,
You're indeed a bee,
Not a Christmas Tree,

Oh Bumblebee, All Bumblebees, 
You're all the cutest of the insects,
With your furry coats,
And your little wings,
You make my day,
I hope you're here to stay.

Oh busy bees,
Pollen on your knees,
Do you ever sneeze?
Oh tell me please!
